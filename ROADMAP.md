- fix autocomplete to have tab completion as well
- maybe show currently running model and OS at all times... 
- add ability to be able to do the classifying via lmstudio as well, to be fully local
- show initially starting models (classifying and response models) in main help dashboard
- make sure all command outputs are added to history so you can ask the ai about what you just did
- powershell scripts error, how to get around it....
