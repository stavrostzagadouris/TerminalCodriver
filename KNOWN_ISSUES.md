# Known Issues

- No tab completion -- working on it though not sure if this is possible but I sure hope it is!
- Need a `!help` command to list banner again once it's scrolled off screen if needed.
- Certain powershell commands won't execute as they act like scripts and no matter your execution policy, it doesn't seem to be enable-able within the python subprocess. :( not sure what to do about this....
